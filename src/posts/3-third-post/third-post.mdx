<h1>A FJK Story</h1>

FJK story is a developing one. If you are reading this then I will share some insight on why I built this. This platform plans to serve as a place where people can read stories currently happening and impacting them. It is designed to keep them aware and offer insights that they seek. 

It also gives users the ability to upload  stories of their own that they wish to share with the world 

The goal is to offer fast connectivity rapid to wherever you are in the world whether you want to read or share your story. It is built using a stack of Gatsby.js, MDX and GraphQl.
