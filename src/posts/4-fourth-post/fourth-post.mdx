<h1>How to be more productive with Pomodoro Technique</h1>

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

<h1>How it works </h1>


<h1> 1) Decide on the task to be done. </h1>
<h1> 2) Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)</h1>
<h1> 3) Work on the task. </h1>
<h1> 4) End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper </h1>
<h1> 5) After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes) and then repeat </h1>
