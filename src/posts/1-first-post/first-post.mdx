<h1>What was the impact of Covid-19 on the elderly?</h1>

During the crisis of COVID-19, all humans are being impacted by some measure. Something to think about is how people are being impacted. This article hopes to articulate this thought.

first are the lives we have lost. These lives are the ones we must always honor and remember. Elderly, over 60 with medical conditions are being impacted the most. Nursing homes have seen a surge in deaths. The federal government has not released a count of its own but Associated Press has been keeping a tally based on media reports and state health departments. As of 4/10/2020 the latest count is at 3,621 which was just 450 10 days ago according to a report by Times.  

As of 4/21/2020 a nationwide tally by The New York Times has found the number of people living in or connected to nursing homes who have died of the coronavirus to be at least 7,000, far higher than previously known. These are just the outbreaks we know about. Most states have not been giving details of the outbreak. 

The virus is known to be more deadly to aging, immune-compromised people, and small, confined settings like nursing homes, where workers frequently move from one room to the next, are particularly vulnerable to spreading infection. Virus tests and protective gear have been scarce inside many of these facilities, which are among the most overlooked category in the United States health care system. The staff at these homes also do not recieve extensive training compared to hospitals and many employees are compensated poorly.

The nursing home facilities were late to require workers and residents to wear masks and some were still not enforcing such policies according to family members. “The residents and staff are being led to slaughter,” said Judith Regan, an editor and publishing executive whose 91-year-old father, Leo Regan, lives at the Long Island State Veterans Home at Stony Brook University. At least 57 residents and 37 staff members there have tested positive for the virus, and 32 residents have died. “He is on the Titanic, but there are no lifeboats,” Ms. Regan said. Officials at the veterans home did not respond to requests for comment according to a New York Times article. 

Many of these nursing homes are also being strongly critized for their lack of actions. Several have faced secrutiny from the State government to staff. Several have been subjected to receiving low grades and many have been labeled as a place where owners have prioritized their profits over the well-being of patients and staff. 

 The second category of people are the ones who are fighting currently. A recent article by The New York Times offers some hope. It talks about hope for the maternity ward in brooklyn fighting covid-19. Nearly 200 babies have arrived since march and some of the pregnant women have fallen extremely ill. According to the article, A 31-year old pregnant women with lungs ravaged by coronavirus, hooked up to a ventilator, neither her or her child getting enough air with only chance of being saved included doctors delivering her baby. But this would be two months before the due date, and the infant could be born with preliminary health issues while the mother herself is fighting coronavirus. Doctors are hopeful for these battles however, since not one mother or baby has been lost. There have been no confirmed cases among newborns, though doctors are awaiting results for one, according to the chair of pediatrics, Dr. Noah Kondamudi.

The ones who are helping during these times include the health care providers. According to an article by US News, states are not consistently tracking health care workers infected with coronavirus and staff shortages could be coming. It is unclear of how many are falling and ill and whether current hospital measures are adequately protecting the staff from the virus. As supplies grow scares, this will increase the likelihood of infections among health care workers which can lead to a shortage of the very people needed to heal the ill. 

This is a developing story with more contributions that will be added. Currently it has not been released yet
