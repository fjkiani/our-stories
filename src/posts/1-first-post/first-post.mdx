<h1>Impact of COVID-19 </h1>

During the crisis of COVID-19, all humans are being impacted by some measure. Something to think about is how people are being impacted. This article hopes to articulate this thought.

first are the lives we have lost. These lives are the ones we must always honor and remember. Elderly, over 60 with medical conditions are being impacted the most. Nursing homes have seen a surge in deaths. The federal government has not released a count of its own but Associated Press has been keeping a tally based on media reports and state health departments. As of 4/10/2020 the latest count is at 3,621 which was just 450 10 days ago according to a report by Times.  

As of 4/21/2020 a nationwide tally by The New York Times has found the number of people living in or connected to nursing homes who have died of the coronavirus to be at least 7,000, far higher than previously known. These are just the outbreaks we know about. Most states have not been giving details of the outbreak. 

confined settings like nursing homes, where workers frequently move from one room to the next, are particularly vulnerable to spreading infection. Virus tests and protective gear have been scarce inside many of these facilities, which are among the most overlooked category in the United States health care system. The nursing home facilities were late to require workers and residents to wear masks and some were still not enforcing such policies according to family members until it was too late.

On 4/13/2020, the police in a small new Jersey town received an anonymous tip about a body being stored in a shed outside one of the largest nusing homes. When the police arrived, the corpse had been removed from the shed, but they discovered 17 bodies piled inside the nursing home. The 17 were among 68 recent deaths linked to the long-term care facility, Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I and II, including two nurses, officials said. Of those who died, 26 people had tested positive for the virus.

For the others, the cause of death is unknown according to an article written by the New York Times. 

The challenge that has been presented with all nursing homes is that once it there is an incident of COVID-19, it spreads like wildfire and is very hard to stop. Even prior to the pandemic, nursing home have struggled. Many have been received "below average" ratings of one-star. These ratings have been provided by Medicare for staffing levels, inspections and patient care. Many have also been labeled as a place where owners have prioritized their profits over the well-being of patients and staff. “The residents and staff are being led to slaughter,” said Judith Regan, an editor and publishing executive whose 91-year-old father, Leo Regan, lives at 
the Long Island State Veterans Home at Stony Brook University according to a New York Times article. 

“It’s pretty clear that a big weakness in the system, and in reality, is long-term care facilities,” quoted by the governor of new jersey, phill murphy

 The second category of people are the ones who are fighting currently. A recent article by The New York Times offers some hope. It talks about hope for the maternity ward in brooklyn fighting covid-19. Nearly 200 babies have arrived since march and some of the pregnant women have fallen extremely ill. According to the article, A 31-year old pregnant women with lungs ravaged by coronavirus, hooked up to a ventilator, neither her or her child getting enough air with only chance of being saved included doctors delivering her baby. But this would be two months before the due date, and the infant could be born with preliminary health issues while the mother herself is fighting coronavirus. Doctors are hopeful for these battles however, since not one mother or baby has been lost. There have been no confirmed cases among newborns, though doctors are awaiting results for one, according to the chair of pediatrics, Dr. Noah Kondamudi.

The ones who are helping during these times include the health care providers. According to an article by US News, states are not consistently tracking health care workers infected with coronavirus and staff shortages could be coming. It is unclear of how many are falling and ill and whether current hospital measures are adequately protecting the staff from the virus. Health workers are particularly at risk of infection and death, perhaps because they absorb such large quantities of the virus. As supplies grow scares, this will increase the likelihood of infections among health care workers which can lead to a shortage of the very people needed to heal the ill. 

New York City which ranks number 1 for cases and deaths is also the home of many of its essential workers. The bronx, predominantly, is where they live. The bronx is not only the poorest borough in the city, it is the poorest in the nation. It also ranks as the state's worst rates for astma, diabetes, hypertension and obesity. This puts the residents at a disproportionately high risk of death. In new york city as many as four out of five covid-19 patients who are intubated may not survive.    

New Yorkers have been dying of Covid-19 at a rate of almost 800 per day according to a New York Times article and this could be significantly undercounted. According to the article, upon a death, doctors fill out paperwork for the death certificate, and nurses and technicians prepare the body and attach a toe tag. In the old days, the body would be covered with a sheet and rolled to the morgue; now it is encased first in one body bag and then in a second, and a team takes the body to the hospital morgue, and then because there is no space, to a refrigerated truck outside that is replaced every couple of days.

The Covid-19 wave may now be passing over New York — which means it will soon hit other places that were too relaxed about social distancing. “They should learn from New York,” Dr. Esses said. “Because if they don’t learn, then the same thing will happen there. And by the time they realize this, it’s too late.”
