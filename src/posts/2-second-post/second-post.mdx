<h1>The great gatsby for everybody </h1>

Gatsby.js is a framework that lets you build fast apps and websites. What this means is that the load time between switching pages is very minimal because Gatsby.js only loads what you computer needs. I used it to build my portfolio website and wanted to share some reasons.

<h1> builds websites that SEO and Images LOVE!  </h1>

Gatsby.js builds optimized websites that are "enhanced" to be highly performant. They are considered enhanced bceause Gatsby offers many plugins. For SEO, Gatsby offers a plugin to highly enhance the SEO on you website. 


If you are using images, Gatsby optimizes the images to save you from manually resizing them by writing more code. A pluggin for images automatically does it for you. Since Gatsby takes care of optimizing your pictures, when the renders the images, they are at their highest resolution. 

<h1> App Like Experience  </h1>

By enhancing performance boost to deliver the smoothest experience to the user, Gatsby gives you a full app-like experience. Gatsby solves many problems with less time spent on configuration and more time on desinging and developing the website.

Netlify offers an easy to use interface that lets you upload and manage your site easily. If your website requires no server, Netlify is the perfect place to host. The benefits of Netlify include that it does not cost anything to host. They are very generious with their stack and let you deploy as many projects as you would lile.

<h1> Get found everywhere </h1>

Since your website will be very optimized (Images, SEO, Tech-Stack + many more), google will like it. If google likes your site, they upvoke your site (web crawlers). By upvoking your site, anytime you type in a specific keyword "fahad kiani website", it ranks high in the search

I used the udemy course and youtube video below to get myself started with Gatsby. This was after I deployed my first HTML,CSS and JavaScript site. I spent some time learning React before jumping straight into Gatsby. Since my goal was to build a portfolio website www.FahadKiani.com, I discovered Gatsby was the perfect stack with its enhanced user-experience performance.
